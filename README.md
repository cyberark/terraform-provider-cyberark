## Overview

The CyberArk Terraform Provider is open source and available on GitHub.

The CyberArk Terraform Provider can interact with CyberArk resources including Privileged Cloud, PAM Self-Hosted, and Secrets Hub and can create safes, accounts, secret stores and sync policies.

Note: Supported platforms for account creation are AWS, Azure, and MySQL databases.

The CyberArk Terraform Provider includes the following features and benefits:

Configuration in the Terraform manifest

Provider authentication to CyberArk Identity Security Platform Shared Services

A Provider can create Safes and Accounts in CyberArk Privileged Cloud and PAM Self-Hosted, as well as Secret Stores and Sync Policies in Secrets Hub

Terraform's `sensitive` variable argument is used by default for sensitive values to keep the value from appearing in logs and on-screen.

## Authentication

The CyberArk Terraform Provider authenticates to CyberArk Identity Security Platform Shared Services with the service account and its credential. When using PAM Self-Hosted, the provider authenticates with the on-prem PVWA instance.

## Install the CyberArk Terraform Provider plugin

You can use any of the following methods to install the CyberArk Terraform Provider plugin:

Install using binaries (Recommended)

Compile source code

Access from the Terraform registry

Install using Homebrew (macOS only)

### Binaries (Recommended)

We recommend installing the CyberArk Terraform Provider plugin (terraform-provider-cyberark) using the appropriate binary distribution for your environment.

In the following examples, replace `$VERSION` with the latest release for your operating system from the GitHub Releases page.

Note: The following example uses a Linux binary.

1. Download the CyberArk Terraform Provider (darwin_amd64 or linux_amd64):

```sh
$  wget https://github.com/cyberark/terraform-provider-cyberark/releases/download/v$VERSION/terraform-provider-cyberark_$VERSION.linux_amd64.zip
```
2. Create a new subdirectory:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cyberark/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```
3. Decompress the binary into the appropriate plugins directory:

```sh
$ unzip terraform-provider-cyberark_$VERSION_linux_amd64.zip ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cyberark/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```
4. To uninstall or remove the previous version of the plugin, run the following command:

```sh
$ rm -rf ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cyberark/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```

### Homebrew (MacOS)
To install the CyberArk Terraform Provider using Homebrew:

1. Add and update the CyberArk Tools Homebrew tap:

```sh
$ brew tap cyberark/tools
```

2. Install the CyberArk Terraform Provider and symlink it to Terraform's plugins directory. Symlinking is necessary because Homebrew is sandboxed and cannot write to your home directory.

   Run the following, where $VERSION is the appropriate plugin version:
_Note: Replace `$VERSION` with the appropriate plugin version_

```sh
$ brew install terraform-provider-cyberark

$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/

$ # If Homebrew is installing somewhere other than `/usr/local/Cellar`, update the path as well.

$ ln -sf /usr/local/Cellar/terraform-provider-cyberark/$VERSION/bin/terraform-provider-cyberark_* \
    ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```
3. If you have a previously downloaded unversioned plugin, remove it:
```sh
$ brew uninstall terraform-provider-cyberark
$ rm -f ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-cyberark
```
4. Create the Terraform plugins folder if it does not already exist:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```
5. Copy the new binary to the Terraform plugins folder:
```sh
$ mv terraform-provider-cyberark*/terraform-provider-cyberark* ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```

### Compile from Source

Before you compile the CyberArk Terraform Provider from the source code, make sure you have Go version 1.21 installed on your machine.

To compile the CyberArk Terraform Provider:

macOS/Linux

1. Clone the repository and open the cloned directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cyberark/terraform-provider-cyberark.git
$ cd terraform-provider-cyberark
```

2. Build the CyberArk Terraform Provider

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cyberark/$VERSION/$platform_reference_in_go
# Example: platform_reference_in_go= darwin_amd64/linux_amd64
# Note: If a static binary is required, use ./bin/build to create the executable
$ go build -o ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cyberark/$VERSION/$platform_reference_in_go/terraform-provider-cyberark main.go
```

### Terraform registry

To access the CyberArk Terraform Provider from the Terraform registry:

In the main.tf configuration file:

- In the source, use registry.terraform.io/cyberark/cyberark

- In version, provide the latest version

```sh
variable "secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

terraform {
    required_providers {
      cyberark = {
        source  = â€œregistry.terraform.io/cyberark/cyberark"version = "~> 0"
      }
    }
  }

provider "cyberark" {
  tenant        = "aarp0000"
  domain        = "example-domain"
  client_id     = "automation@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  client_secret = var.secret_key
}
resource "cyberark_safe" "AAM_Test_Safe" {
  safe_name          = "GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  safe_desc          = "Description for GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  member             = "demo@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  member_type        = "user"
  permission_level   = "read" # full, read, approver, manager
  retention          = 7
  retention_versions = 7
  purge              = false
  cpm_name           = "PasswordManager"
  safe_loc           = ""
}
```

## Caution: Handling Sensitive Files

Important: The Terraform state file and .tfvars files contain sensitive information related to your configurations. It is essential to handle these files with the utmost care to ensure their security.

### Best Practices

- Keep Files Private: Ensure these files are not exposed to unauthorized individuals or systems.
- Restrict Access: Limit access to these files to authorized personnel only.
- Use Encryption: Whenever possible, use encryption for both storage and transmission to protect the contents of these files.

Following these practices helps safeguard your sensitive data.

## Configure CyberArk Terraform Provider

This section describes how to configure the CyberArk Terraform Provider.

### Workflow

Terraform can be executed manually by the user. The CyberArk Terraform Provider reads the provider configuration and authenticates to the tenant using the service account and its credentials.

Once authenticated, it configures the resources according to the main.tf file. After setup, the resources can be viewed in Privilege Cloud and Secrets Hub.

### Use environment variables for Sensitive Variables

In order to use environment variables with Terraform Provider SecrestsHub use the Terraform variables and [standard mechanism]
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#environment-variables).

### Example

#### Privileged Cloud

```terraform
variable "secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "cyberark" {
  tenant        = "aarp0000"
  domain        = "example-domain"
  client_id     = "automation@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  client_secret = var.secret_key
}

resource "cyberark_safe" "PCloud_Test_Safe" {
  safe_name          = "GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  safe_desc          = "Description for GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  member             = "demo@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  member_type        = "user"
  permission_level   = "read" # full, read, approver, manager
  retention          = 7
  retention_versions = 7
  purge              = false
  cpm_name           = "PasswordManager"
  safe_loc           = ""
}
```

#### PAM Self-Hosted

```terraform
variable "secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

variable "pvwa_password" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "cyberark" {
  tenant        = "aarp0000"
  domain        = "example-domain"
  client_id     = "automation@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  client_secret = var.secret_key

  # For PAM Self-Hosted
  pvwa_url      = "https://pvwa.example.com"
  pvwa_username = "myUser"
  pvwa_password = var.pvwa_password
}

resource "cyberark_pam_safe" "PAM_Test_Safe" {
  safe_name          = "GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  safe_desc          = "Description for GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  member             = "demo@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  member_type        = "user"
  permission_level   = "read" # full, read, approver, manager
  retention          = 7
  retention_versions = 7
  purge              = false
  cpm_name           = "PasswordManager"
  safe_loc           = ""
  enable_olac        = false
}
```

```sh
$ export TF_VAR_secret_key=my-secret-key
$ export TF_VAR_pvwa_password=my-pvwa-password
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```

## Pre-requisties for Provider and Resources

- A tenant with both Privilege Cloud and Secrets Hub is required.
- Create and enable a service account and its associated secret.
- An AWS account with the SecretHub IAM role is necessary.
- Get the Privilege Cloud secret store ID via the API or user interface and insert it into the source_id section of the sync policy.

  1. UI: Log in to the CyberArk tenant with sufficient privileges to view the Privilege Cloud store details.

  2. API : Use the documentation below to make an API call and retrieve the Privilege Cloud StoreID. (https://docs.cyberark.com/secrets-hub-privilege-cloud/Latest/en/Content/Developer/sh-policy-api-tutorial.htm?tocpath=Developer%7CTutorials%7C_____4).

## Resource Lifecycle Management

The CyberArk Terraform Provider supports complete lifecycle management for resources including import, update, and delete operations.

### Importing Existing Resources

You can import existing resources into your Terraform state using the `terraform import` command. This is useful when you want to start managing existing infrastructure with Terraform.

```sh
# Import an existing AWS account
terraform import cyberark_aws_account.my_account <account_id>

# Import an existing safe
terraform import cyberark_safe.my_safe <safe_name>

# Import an existing sync policy
terraform import cyberark_sync_policy.my_policy <policy_id>
```

### Updating Resources

Resources can be updated by modifying your Terraform configuration and running `terraform apply`.

#### Safe Update Example
```terraform
resource "cyberark_safe" "my_safe" {
  safe_name        = "example_safe"
  safe_desc        = "Updated safe description"  # Modified field
  member           = "secretshub"
  member_type      = "user"
  permission_level = "full"
  retention        = 14  # Modified retention period
  purge            = false
}
```

#### Account Update Example
```terraform
resource "cyberark_aws_account" "my_account" {
  name                        = "aws-account"
  username                    = "aws-user"
  platform                    = "AWS"
  safe                        = "aws_safe"
  secret                      = var.secret_key
  secret_name_in_secret_store = "updated_aws_secret_name"  # Modified field
  sm_manage                   = true  # Modified field
  sm_manage_reason            = "Updated for compliance"  # Modified field
  aws_kid                     = var.aws_key_id
  aws_account_id              = var.aws_account_id
  aws_alias                   = var.aws_alias
  aws_account_region          = var.aws_region
}
```

#### Secret Store Update Example
```terraform
resource "cyberark_aws_secret_store" "my_secret_store" {
  name               = "aws-secret-store"
  description        = "Updated AWS store description"  # Modified field
  aws_account_id     = var.aws_account_id
  aws_account_region = "us-east-1"
  aws_account_alias  = "updated-aws-alias"  # Modified field
  aws_iam_role       = var.aws_iam_role
}
```

#### Sync Policy Update Example
```terraform
resource "cyberark_sync_policy" "my_policy" {
  name        = "sync-policy"
  description = "Updated policy description"  # Modified field
  safe_name   = var.safe_name
  source_id   = var.source_id
  target_id   = var.target_id
}
```

### Deleting Resources

Resources can be deleted by removing them from your Terraform configuration and running `terraform apply`, or by using `terraform destroy` for the entire configuration.

```sh
# Delete a specific resource
terraform destroy -target=cyberark_aws_account.my_account

# Delete all resources in the configuration
terraform destroy
```
